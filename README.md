IP-Checker
==========

This is a simple tool which I am developing to check the [Public IP](https://www.ipify.org) of your home internet. If it detects that your IP Address has changed since this last ran, it will text your contact last (defined within) using the [textbelt.com](http://www.textbelt.com) API
